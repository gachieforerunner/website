VEGM operates several churches across Kenya, with each church being led by a pastor and a team of elders. The ministry's pastors are trained to deliver sermons that are grounded in biblical teachings and relevant to the everyday lives of their congregants. In addition to church services, VEGM organizes retreats, seminars, and workshops to help members deepen their faith and understanding of God's word.

Aside from religious services, VEGM also runs several institutions, including a primary school, a secondary school, and a health center. These institutions are designed to provide quality education and healthcare to members of the community, regardless of their religious affiliation. The primary and secondary schools offer a holistic education that integrates Christian values, while the health center provides medical care and counseling services.

One of the unique features of VEGM is that it offers its facilities to other ministries to host events. This gesture is a testament to the ministry's commitment to promoting unity among Christians and fostering a sense of community. Churches and other organizations can book VEGM's facilities to host conferences, seminars, and other events.
