**Editing and Updating the Website**

The website has been designed to use the most affordable setup while also being at the same time user-friendly. A backend which handles user authentication which requires a database has not been implemented in order to make backing up the website (on github), and optional hosting on the same, easier than it would otherwise be. The authentication is done instead using google accounts.

1.  > Creating the Google accounts

\>\> This part has already been done for you for the email provided to you.

These are the steps for creating a Google account. Either a Gmail account or a personal private email account can be used. The steps provided are for a private email account.

  - > Once you have set up your email server, either self-hosted (like a mail-in-a-box server) or otherwise, you need to create an email account. To easily remember which email you will use, we propose you use `media@your-domain`

  - > Create a youtube account using that email address. For this go to youtube, or any other Google service and click either `sign in` or if you are already logged in to Google, click your profile picture, then `switch account`, then `add account`. You should end up on the following page.

  - > Click on `Create Account` and select `For work or my Business`

  - > Create the account using your private email account for your domain.

<!-- end list -->

2.  > Creating a GitHub Account

\>\> This step has also been done for you.

To replicate, simply to go [<span class="underline">github</span>](http://github.com/) and create a new account.

3.  > Clone the GitHub repo

\>\> This step has also been done for you.

The repo cloned has a single template. You will have to edit or add new templates if you want your website to look different from how the template looks.

4.  > Copy Drive template

Create the drive template with an email that will not change so the template is always available… Or download the template and put in drive,, that will be easier to do and provide a script to copy it for us to drive…

5.  > Set up SSh in the Repo

6.  > Copy Colab

7.  > Run the colab…

8.  > Creating new posts

9.  > Editing site details…. sheets

10. > Checking subscriptions… google sheets

11. > Receiving email… formsubmit
